## **Introduction** 🔥

###  ***The Project*** 🎃

Reading books is crucial in our life but sometimes, We are not sure what book we have to read or not. Here is the book hunter shine. [**Book Hunter 📚**](https://bookhunter-edf43.web.app/) introduces good books with proper ratings, reviews and your category, so that you can find the perfect one for your taste. Also you can share your favorite book so other people can read it too. Book Hunter may help you to get the perfect book for your needs but it can’t provide a download file or pdf format ,so if you want to buy or read it you have to find another way. When you are not sure what book to read next, this is the right place for you. Book Hunter clarifies what book you have to read next .Book Hunter can be used by anyone who can use the internet.

I think that the book is the most expensive things in the world because of that we have to share what we have to the other people.

That is why I call it a book hunter.

### ***Future*** 🔭

Book Hunter is an online book library. It is a platform that makes the process of finding the perfect book as easy as possible. It enables you to find, share and download shard book by other people from all over the world.
